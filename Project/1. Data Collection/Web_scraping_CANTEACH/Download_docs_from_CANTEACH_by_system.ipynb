    "## Downloading articles by system technology from CANTEACH\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python script automates the process of scraping and downloading PDF documents from the CANTEACH website (https://canteach.candu.org/Pages/Home.aspx). It uses Selenium for web scraping and BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content. The script is structured to handle interruptions and resume progress, ensuring efficient and complete downloads. Below is a detailed explanation of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup and Initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "The script imports necessary libraries for web scraping, browser automation, and file handling.\n",
    "- It defines the base URL of the CANTEACH website, the main page URL containing system links, and the local directory where the documents will be saved.\n",
    "- It ensures that the directory for saving documents exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up Selenium WebDriver:\n",
    "\n",
    "The script initializes the Selenium WebDriver for Firefox, with an option to run headless.\n",
    "- It clears all cookies to avoid issues with large request headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting System URLs:\n",
    "\n",
    "The script sends a request to the main page to get URLs for different systems.\n",
    "- It parses the HTML content of the page to find links that contain \"Forms\" in their href attribute, as these are the links to the system pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scraping Document Links:\n",
    "\n",
    "The script uses Selenium to navigate each system page and collect PDF document links.\n",
    "- It opens each system URL, clears cookies again, and waits for the page to load completely.\n",
    "- It locates elements containing the text 'Title', which, when expanded, reveal the PDF links.\n",
    "- It scrolls each 'Title' element into view and clicks on it to expand the section, then collects all PDF links from the expanded sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Downloading Documents:\n",
    "\n",
    "The script downloads each PDF document and saves it to the specified folder.\n",
    "- It handles exceptions to ensure the script continues running even if a download fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving and Loading Progress:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The script saves the progress of downloaded URLs to a file, allowing it to resume from where it left off if interrupted.\n",
    "- It loads the progress from the file upon restart.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "The main function orchestrates the entire process:\n",
    "- Sets up the Selenium WebDriver.\n",
    "- Loads progress if it exists, or scrapes the main page to get system URLs.\n",
    "- Iterates through each system URL, scrapes document links, and downloads the documents.\n",
    "- Saves progress after each download.\n",
    "- Handles exceptions to skip problematic URLs and continue with the next."
