Setup and Imports\n","The script begins by installing necessary packages (requests, boto3, google-cloud-storage).\n","It then imports the required modules (requests, time).\n","\n","2. Defining Functions\n","##### search_wikipedia(keyword):\n","\n","This function searches Wikipedia for articles containing a specific keyword along with \"Canada\" and \"nuclear\".\n","- It makes a request to the Wikipedia API with the search parameters.\n","- It returns a list of article titles that match the search criteria.\n","\n","##### fetch_wikipedia_article(title):\n","\n","This function fetches the content of a Wikipedia article given its title.\n","- It makes a request to the Wikipedia API to get the plain text extract of the article.\n","- It returns the extracted text of the article.\n","\n","##### count_words(text):\n","\n","This function counts the number of words in a given text.\n","- It splits the text into words and returns the count.\n","\n","3. Defining Keywords\n","A comprehensive list of keywords related to nuclear topics is defined. These keywords are used to search for relevant Wikipedia articles. the list was prepared using multiple sources:\n","- Glossary of CNSC Terminology (REGDOC-3.6): This glossary provided specific terminologies related to nuclear safety and security.\n","- CNSC Regulatory Documents: Names of the documents were sourced from the CNSC website.\n","- Common Sense and Google Keywords Search: Additional relevant keywords were identified using common sense and Google searches.\n","\n","4. Main Execution Block\n","The script initializes counters for the total number of articles and total word count, and records the start time.\n","\n","For Each Keyword:\n","\n","- It searches for Wikipedia articles containing the keyword and \"Canada\" and \"nuclear\".\n","- For each article title found, it fetches the article content.\n","- If the article content mentions \"Canada\", it saves the article text to a file named with the keyword and article title.\n","- It updates the total article count and word count.\n","\n","The script prints progress messages, including the titles of saved articles and any articles that did not meet the criteria.\n","\n","After processing all keywords, it prints the total number of articles saved, the total word count, and the total time taken for the execution.\n","\n","### Key Points\n","* Search and Fetch: The script searches for Wikipedia articles using a combination of specific keywords and additional terms to ensure relevance. It fetches the article content and checks if it mentions \"Canada\".\n","* Save Articles: Articles that meet the criteria are saved locally with filenames incorporating the keyword and article title.\n","* Progress Reporting: The script provides feedback on progress, including counts of articles saved and word counts.\n","* Efficiency: The script measures and prints the total time taken for execution, providing insights into its performance."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"4f57df2c","metadata":{"id":"4f57df2c","outputId":"49cf57e3-977e-4aba-bc86-1a86d185f347"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Requirement
