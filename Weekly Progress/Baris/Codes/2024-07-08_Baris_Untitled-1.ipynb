      "a determination of the isotopic content in the core sensitive to such diversion. \n",

      "sample the whole core, without attenuation, and would bring valuable information on the \n",
      "power with totally different systematics than present methods. \n",
      "Even if its measurement is not dissuasive by itself, the operator cannot hide any stops \n",
      "or change of power, and in most case, such a record made with an external and independent \n",
      "device, virtually impossible to fake, will act as a strong constraint. \n",
      "In spite of the uncertainty mentioned previously, we see that the most energetic part \n",
      "offers the best possibility to disentangle fission from 235U and 239Pu. The comparison between \n",
      "the cumulative numbers of antineutrinos as a function of antineutrino energy detected at low \n",
      "vs. high energy is an efficient observable to distinguish pure 235U and 239Pu. \n",
      "IAEA seeks also monitoring large spent-fuel elements. For this application, the \n",
      "likelihood is that antineutrino detectors could only make measurements on large quantities of \n",
      "beta-emitters, e.g., several cores of spent fuel. In the time of the experiment the discharge of \n",
