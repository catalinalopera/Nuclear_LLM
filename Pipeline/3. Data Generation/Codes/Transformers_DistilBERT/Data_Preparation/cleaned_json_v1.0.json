            "Content ": "There are seven licensed nuclear power plant (NPP) sites in Canada, operated by four different  licensees. These NPP sites range in size from one to four power reactors, all of which are of the  CANDU (CANada Deuterium Uranium) design.  Each year, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) publishes a report on the safety  performance of Canada’s NPPs. The CNSC Staff Integrated Safety Assessment of Canadian  Nuclear Power Plants (NPP Report) assesses the safety performance at each NPP, while also  making generic observations and identifying trends for the nuclear power industry, as a whole.  As part of this assessment, the CNSC evaluates how well licensees are meeting regulatory  requirements and expectations for the performance of programs in nine safety areas, as follows:  • Operating Performance  • Performance Assurance  • Design and Analysis  • Equipment Fitness for Service  • Emergency Preparedness  • Environmental Protection  • Radiation Protection  • Site Security  • Safeguards  The evaluations in this report were based on findings made throughout the year during  inspections, desktop reviews, event reviews and reviews of performance indicators.  The NPP Report includes a rating for each program and safety area (except Security, which is  provided in a separate, classified report) and an integrated plant rating for each NPP. The  integrated plant rating is a general measure of the overall acceptability of the performance of the  entire set of applicable programs and safety areas for each NPP, as measured against the relevant  requirements and expectations.  Overall Performance Highlights  CNSC staff concludes that NPPs in Canada operated safely during 2009, and that licensees made  adequate provisions to protect the health and safety of Canadians and the environment, as well as  to ensure that Canada continued to meet its international obligations on the peaceful use of  nuclear energy. This conclusion is based on observations that:  • There were no serious process failures at any station.  • No member of the public received a radiation dose in excess of the regulatory limits.  • There were no confirmed worker radiation exposures in excess of the regulatory dose  limits.  • The frequency and severity of injuries/accidents involving workers was minimal.  • All environmental emissions from the stations were below regulatory limits.  CNSC Staff Integrated Safety Assessment of Canadian Nuclear Power Plants for 2009  6 Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission  • Licensees complied with their licence conditions concerning Canada’s international  obligations  The operational events that occurred at the NPPs in 2009 had minimal impact on health, safety  and the environment, and Canada’s obligations on the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Licensees  reported all such events (as per S-99 reporting requirements) and conducted, or are conducting,  appropriate follow-up activities, which include root cause analysis and corrective action, as  needed. One event—the alpha contamination at Bruce A in November 2009—was still under  investigation at the time of writing; preliminary investigation indicates that regulatory dose limits  had not been exceeded.  These positive outcomes were the result of a multitude of provisions undertaken by each  licensee. The CNSC’s evaluation of the safety areas at each NPP confirmed, at a more detailed  level, that the licensees’ provisions to protect health, safety and the environment, and help  honour Canada’s international obligations met the CNSC’s performance expectations. The 2009  ratings for the safety areas and the integrated plant ratings are presented in the table below for all  NPPs, along with the industry averages."

The 2010 NPP Report has undergone changes made necessary by the introduction of new  safety and control areas (SCAs). The 14 SCAs, comprising 69 specific areas, were  introduced and assessed for safety performance in the NPP Report.  The report consists of two major parts. Part 1 provides the assessment of the safety  performance for the nuclear power industry as a whole and for each specific station, for  the entire 2010 calendar year. Part 2 provides detailed information on licensing and other  regulatory issues pertaining to each specific station (it covers the period from January  2010 to April 2011, thereby permitting a more recent view of issues at each of the NPPs).  Overall performance highlights  As a result of the assessment of inspection findings and desktop reviews, and reviews of  events and performance indicators, CNSC staff conclude that the licensed NPPs in  Canada operated safely during 2010. This conclusion is based on the observations that:  • There were no serious process failures at any NPP.  • No members of the public received a radiation dose in excess of the regulatory  limits.  • No workers were confirmed to receive a radiation dose in excess of the regulatory  limits.  • The severity of non-radiological injuries to workers was minimal.  • All environmental emissions from the stations were below regulatory limits.  • Licensees complied with their licence conditions concerning Canada’s  international obligations for the peaceful use of nuclear energy.

All those wishing to carry out nuclear-related  activities—including activities related to the design, construction, operation, decommissioning  and abandonment of nuclear facilities and the production, possession and use of nuclear  substances—must first obtain a licence from the CNSC. We provide guidance to applicants  and licensees about the regulatory requirements that apply to them. Our staff conduct independent evaluation and research to support our requirements and decisions.  We also participate in international initiatives to advance our knowledge and improve our safety and  regulatory regimes for such issues as new nuclear reactor designs, aging facilities, decommis sioning practices, and the effects of radiation on people and the environment. The Commission  Tribunal—the central decision-making body of the CNSC—in addition to making licensing  decisions for all major nuclear facilities in Canada, requires periodic reports on the safety of  nuclear facilities and regularly reviews key information on events and incidents that occur. The CNSC’s Audit Committee with three external and two internal members reinforces the  effectiveness of internal audits. It oversees key areas and processes such as values and  ethics, risk management, management control and accountability reporting. A mandate to ensure safety The CNSC uses risk-informed regulatory approaches to inform our licensing and compliance  activities. This means that we assess the probability of a nuclear-related event occurring, the  impacts it would have on normal operations and the resulting consequences if the event occur.  We also ensure that mitigation measures are in place to prevent such occurences. For facilities or activities where accidents or malfunctions could have severe consequences,  the CNSC requires licensees to implement operating procedures that include multiple layers of  defence. This defence-in-depth approach helps secure critical areas such as nuclear fuel compo nents to protect workers, public and the environment. Each of the facilities have specific safety  programs, which provide additional lines of defence. That way, if a safety system or program fails,  others are in place to keep the facility and workers safe, limit potential emissions and provide  enough time to correct the original problem. The CNSC conducts regular inspections to ensure licensees are adhering to their licence  requirements.  A focus on safety and preparedness All licensees are required by the NSCA to demonstrate to the CNSC that their nuclear energy  workers are fully trained to carry out their duties with competence. We also require all nuclear  facilities to have comprehensive emergency preparedness programs. We work with nuclear  operators, municipal, provincial and federal government agencies, first responders and interna tional organizations so that we are ready to respond to a nuclear emergency at any time."

Licensees covered by this report are located across Canada, and Canadian Nuclear  Safety Commission (CNSC) staff acknowledge all relevant treaties and all traditional territories on which  the licensees are situated. Most of these licensees are regulated by the CNSC’s Directorate of Nuclear  Substance Regulation (DNSR). The regulatory oversight report (ROR) also includes selected waste  nuclear substance licensees that are not reported on in other RORs and that are regulated by the  Directorate of Nuclear Cycle and Facilities Regulation.  The report on licensee performance for the 2 high-energy research particle accelerators, which was last  incorporated into the 2019 nuclear substances ROR presented in 2020, is on a 3-year reporting cycle and  would have been included in this ROR. However, these facilities and their performance reporting are more like that of other major CNSC-regulated facilities in Canada and will therefore be reported on in the  Research Reactors and Particle Accelerator Facilities ROR in 2024, which are also on a 3-year reporting  cycle. These 2 licensees did have full Commission licensing hearings, with interventions, in 2022. Based on their assessment of licensee performance results for 2022, CNSC staff continue to conclude that  nuclear substances in Canada are used safely. This conclusion is based on an analysis of the indicators  covered in this report – inspection compliance ratings, enforcement actions, doses to workers, and event  reports. In response to questions from the Commission in 2022 on the compliance ratings indicator, this  year’s report provides additional context on how CNSC staff interpret those ratings. Staff have included  new sections on the role that licensing activities play in assessing compliance and on how they calculate  inspection ratings, to shed light on why there can appear to be downward trends in compliance when there  are no actual performance issues within a sector or subsector. Staff have moved away from comparing  in-year compliance data to the ratings from the previous year, and instead are comparing in-year  compliance data against the 5-year averages of compliance results. This approach takes into account the  fact that different licensees are inspected every year and provides a clearer view of performance trending.  Lastly, CNSC staff have further explained the “unacceptable” versus “below expectations” ratings in  order to distinguish between risks to health and safety requiring immediate action and overall  performance trends requiring longer-term regulatory strategies."

            "Content ": "The dawn of the nuclear age introduced an era both of great promise and responsibility. Along with the  many peaceful applications of nuclear energy comes the potential threat represented by its misuse for  the production of nuclear weapons. This threat requires unprecedented and unanimous commitment to  nuclear non-proliferation. For its part, Canada has consistently taken a leading role in promoting and  developing the principles of non-proliferation, in both the domestic and international arenas.   Phase 1 – Traditional Safeguards  This term applies to IAEA safeguards in Canada implemented in accordance with the comprehensive  safeguards agreement (CSA) between the Government of Canada and the IAEA, which came into  force in 1972 (pursuant to the requirements of the NPT). The purpose of this agreement was to provide   the IAEA with the means to verify, through physical inspections and data analysis, that all declared   nuclear material in Canada remained in peaceful uses and was not diverted to nuclear weapons or other   nuclear explosive devices.   Phase 2 – Strengthened Safeguards  The discovery of Iraq’s clandestine nuclear weapons program in 1990 led to a reassessment of the  effectiveness of the global safeguards regime. Under traditional safeguards, a State declares its nuclear   material and activities and the IAEA verifi es this declaration. This assumes, however, that the State  has submitted a complete declaration and does not have any clandestine nuclear material or activities.   Post-1990 it was recognized that the scope of safeguards should be strengthened to include the credible   assurance of the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities. To that end, the Protocol  Additional to the Safeguards Agreement (commonly referred to as the Additional Protocol or AP) was   created in 1997 and required States to provide more information on their nuclear activities as well as  increased access to locations within the country. Canada was intimately involved in the development of   these strengthening measures and was a forerunner in their implementation, signing the AP in 1998 and   bringing it into force in 2000.  Phase 3 – Integrated Safeguards  Since 2000, the IAEA has been implementing the safeguards agreement as well as the Additional  Protocol in Canada with the ultimate goal of reaching a broad conclusion for Canada based on the  objectives of both of these documents: that all nuclear material declared by Canada was accounted   for and was used solely for peaceful, non-explosive purposes, and that there is credible assurance of the   absence of undeclared nuclear materials or activities in Canada. After fi ve years of extensive effort, in  September 2005, the IAEA drew the broad conclusion for Canada. On the basis of this conclusion, the  Agency can introduce a fundamental change to safeguards implementation in Canada, aimed at   optimization. This new system is called integrated safeguards."

            "Content ": "The existence of nuclear energy carries with it both great promise and  great responsibility. Along with the many peaceful applications of  nuclear technology comes the potential threat represented by its  misuse for the production of nuclear weapons. The international  safeguards system, administered by the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA), is one pillar in the global response to this  threat. The term “safeguards” refers to verification measures aimed  at ensuring a State’s compliance with international non-proliferation  agreements under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). It is  essentially a system of monitoring and tracking nuclear material, to  ensure that none of it is diverted from legitimate peaceful activities  into illicit weapons programs. The CNSC has been designated as the governmental organization responsible for the implementation of  Canada’s safeguards commitments. This report summarizes the work of the Safeguards Program in fulfilling  this responsibility throughout the 2007-08 fiscal year. The report is organized around the strategic framework of the CNSC. Part I lays out this framework and  indicates how activities carried out by the Safeguards Program throughout the year contributed to the seven  high level program priorities. Part II goes into more depth regarding these activities, while Part III describes  some future directions for the Safeguards Program and international safeguards in general. Part IV provides  information on IAEA activities carried out in Canada in the 2007-08 fiscal year, along with an indication of  effort expended by both the IAEA and the CNSC. Finally, Part V offers some concluding remarks."

            "Content ": "The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) regulates the use of nuclear energy and materials to  protect health, safety, security and the environment, and to implement Canada’s international  commitments on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.  GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy Canada Inc. (GEH-C) is licensed and regulated by the CNSC. GEH-C has  owned and operated a nuclear facility located at 1025 Lansdowne Ave. in Toronto, Ontario since 1955.  The facility produces uranium dioxide (UO2) pellets for use in nuclear power plants. In October 2012,  residents living near the facility raised concerns about the concentration of uranium in soil resulting from  the facility’s air emissions. GEH-C provided soil sampling reports to the public that demonstrated  uranium levels are below the applicable soil quality guidelines; however, concern continued to mount. To  address the public concern, the Ontario Ministry of Environment (MOE) undertook independent soil  sampling in public areas.  The MOE’s soil sampling coincided with GEH-C’s regularly scheduled annual sampling, and each  performed its own soil sample collections in June 2013. The CNSC was present and requested split  samples from both sampling campaigns so it could conduct its own independent analysis to verify results.  The CNSC’s overall conclusion, based on the licensee’s monitoring data and the analysis of the soil  samples, is that uranium concentrations in soil around the GEH-C Toronto facility are well below the  accepted standards for protection of human and environmental health. The public living near the facility  and the environment are protected and safe from the facility’s nuclear activities.  Naturally Occurring Uranium and Soil Quality Guidelines  Uranium is a naturally occurring alpha-emitting radioactive element; it is present at low levels in various  rocks and ores, soil, water, air and plants as well as animal tissue. In Ontario, natural background levels of  uranium in soil are generally below 2.5 µg/g (micrograms per gram).  To protect human health and the environment, soil quality guidelines have been established by the  Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME). The guidelines represent levels of uranium  in soil below which no risk to human health is expected. For residential and parkland land use, the  guideline is 23 µg/g; for commercial use, the guideline is 33 µg/g. Findings higher than these guidelines  would suggest there may be a need for further investigation, to determine the source of the uranium in soil  and the potential site-specific health risks."

            "Content ": "Safety objectives and concepts The safety objectives and concepts described in this section apply to a reactor facility during operation  or during an accident. Four common plant states are defined: normal operation, anticipated operational occurrence (AOO), design-basis accident (DBA), and beyond-design-basis accident (BDBA). This document also  introduces the plant state “design extension conditions” (DECs), as a subset of BDBAs that are  considered in the plant design. 2.1 General nuclear safety objective In support of the NSCA and its associated regulations, the CNSC endorses the objective established by  the IAEA that reactor facilities be designed and operated in a manner that will protect individuals,  society and the environment from harm. This objective relies on the establishment and maintenance of  effective defences against radiological hazards in reactor facilities. The general nuclear safety objective is supported by 3 complementary safety objectives, which deal  with radiation protection, the technical aspects of the design, and environmental protection. The  technical safety objective is interdependent with administrative and procedural measures that are taken  to ensure defence against hazards due to ionizing radiation. 2.1.1 Radiation protection objective The radiation protection objective is to ensure that during normal operation, or during anticipated  operational occurrences, radiation exposures within the reactor facility or due to any planned release of  radioactive material from the reactor facility are kept below prescribed limits and as low as reasonably  achievable (ALARA). Provisions shall be made for the mitigation of the radiological consequences of any accidents  considered in the design. 2.1.2 Technical safety objectives The technical safety objectives are to provide all reasonably practicable measures to prevent accidents  in the reactor facility, and to mitigate the consequences of accidents if they do occur. This takes into  account all possible accidents considered in the design, including those of very low probability. When these objectives are achieved, any radiological consequences will be below prescribed limits, and  the likelihood of accidents with serious radiological consequences will be extremely low"

The evaluation examined the  program’s relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and design/delivery for continuous improvement during the  period March 31, 2007 to March 31, 2014. The conduct of this evaluation was undertaken between  October 2012 and March 2014.  Program context Compliance verification has been an integral part of Canada’s nuclear regulatory regime since the  overseeing organization – currently known as the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) – first  came into existence as the Atomic Energy Control Board (AECB) in 1946. The function of the program  was strengthened through the modern legislative framework, under the authority of the Nuclear Safety  and Control Act (NSCA) in 2000.  The Directorate of Nuclear Substance Regulation (DNSR) at the CNSC is responsible for regulating the  production, possession, packaging, transport and use of nuclear substances, radiation devices, Class II  nuclear facilities, and prescribed equipment.  Compliance verification is essential to ensuring that the possession, transport and use of nuclear  substances, prescribed equipment and radiation devices are carried out in a safe manner to protect the  health and safety of workers and the public, as well as to maintain security and protect the environment.  Compliance verification consists of:  • identifying and planning high-priority, risk-informed verification activities • identifying non-compliance without undue delay and according to risk level • conducting inspections in a timely, transparent and risk-informed manner • promoting awareness of regulations and scientific, technical guidance • sharing best practices and lessons learned with stakeholders (licensees, industry and the public) Methodology The CNSC is designated a “small department or agency”1 under the Treasury Board Policy on Evaluation  (April 1, 2009) and is not required to assess the DNSR Compliance Verification Program according to the  five core issue areas. 2 Nevertheless, the CNSC views the five core issue areas as a best practice and has  adopted this structure when performing assessments of its programs and initiatives. This evaluation  addresses the following issues: continued need for the program, achievement of expected outcomes,  efficiency, and design/delivery for continuous improvement."
