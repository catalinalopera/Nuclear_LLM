The JSON format is specifically structured for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with the generated QA pairs. The script utilizes the OpenAI API, which requires a paid API key for access.\n","\n","### Configuration\n","The script begins by setting up necessary configurations, including the source directory for the PDF files, parameters for text chunking, and the OpenAI model settings. It also sets the OpenAI API key required for accessing the language model. This API key must be a valid, paid key to use the OpenAI services.\n","\n","### Functions\n","*Extract Text from PDFs*\n","This function reads all PDF files in the specified directory and extracts their text content. It handles errors, ensuring that the script continues to run even if some files cannot be processed. The extracted text from each PDF is stored in a list.\n","\n","*Chunk Text*\n","This function splits the extracted text into smaller chunks with a specified overlap. The chunking process makes it easier for the language model to process the text, as smaller chunks are more manageable. The function takes in parameters for chunk size and overlap, allowing flexibility in how the text is split.\n","\n","*Generate QA Pairs*\n","This function generates QA pairs from the text chunks using the OpenAI language model. It runs the model on each chunk of text and parses the generated output to extract questions and answers. The function also limits the number of QA pairs generated per chunk to the specified maximum, ensuring that the output is not overly verbose and remains relevant. Since this function relies on the OpenAI API, it requires a paid API key to function.\n","\n","*Save QA Pairs to JSON*\n","This function cleans up the QA pairs by removing any special tags (e.g., <question>, </question>, <answer>, </answer>) and saves the cleaned pairs to a JSON file. The JSON format is required for fine-tuning LLMs with the generated QA pairs. Each QA pair is saved as a dictionary with \"prompt\" and \"response\" keys.\n","\n","*Main Execution*\n","The main execution block orchestrates the entire process. It first extracts text from all PDF files in the specified directory. Then, it splits the extracted text into chunks. For each chunk, the script generates QA pairs and collects them. Finally, it saves all generated QA pairs to a JSON file. Throughout the process, the script prints debugging information to the console, including the number of files processed, chunks created, QA pairs generated, and the final count of QA pairs saved.\n","\n","### Summary of Key Features\n","Text Extraction: The script extracts text from PDF files in the specified directory, handling errors to ensure robustness.\n","\n","Text Chunking: It splits the extracted text into smaller, manageable chunks based on specified chunk size and overlap parameters.\n","\n","QA Pair Generation: The script generates QA pairs using the OpenAI language model, which requires a paid API key.
