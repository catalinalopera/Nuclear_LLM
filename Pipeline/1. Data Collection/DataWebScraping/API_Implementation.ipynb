      "fusion, nuclear non-proliferation, nuclear-geophysics, and nuclear medicine.\n",
      "The review begins with a historic summary of the early years in applied nuclear\n",

      "Abstract: One of the major issues with multiparticle reactors is to handle their\n",
      "multiscale aspect. For modeling, it usually comes to coupling a reactor model\n",
      "(describing the phenomena at the macroscopic scale) with a so-called grain\n",
      "model (simulating the behavior of a single grain or a particle). An interesting\n",
      "approach proposed by H.Y. Sohn (1978) is to use the law of additive reaction\n",
      "times in order to calculate, approximately but analytically, the reaction rate\n",
      "of a particle in the reactor model. Its great advantage, compared to a\n",
      "numerical grain model, is to drastically reduce the computation time,\n",
      "particularly in the case of complex reactor models. This is the approach we\n",
      "retained for modeling the moving bed furnace, a counter-current gas-solid\n",
      "reactor used in the nuclear fuel-making route for producing uranium\n",
      "tetrafluoride from uranium trioxide. The numerical model we developed is\n",
      "2-dimensional, steady-state and based on the finite volume method. It describes\n",
      "solid and gas flow, convective, conductive and radiative heat transfers, and\n",
      "six chemical reactions involved in the process. The law of additive reaction\n",
      "times is used to calculate analytically the rate of the three principal\n",
      "gas-solid reactions at every discrete point in the reactor. We have\n",
      "demonstrated the validity of this approach by comparing its results with those\n",
      "calculated from a numerical grain model. Also detailed in the paper are the\n",
      "main results of the moving bed furnace model itself and the possibilities of\n",

      "Abstract: Advanced nuclear reactors often exhibit complex thermal-fluid phenomena\n",
      "during transients. To accurately capture such phenomena, a coarse-mesh\n",

      "Abstract: Earthquakes are a great challenge for the safety of nuclear reactors. To\n",
      "address this challenge, we need to better understand how the reactor core\n",
      "responds to seismic forcing. The reactor core is made of fuel assemblies, which\n",
      "are themselves composed of flexible fuel rods immersed in a strong axial flow.\n",
      "This gives rise to strongly-coupled fluid-structure interactions whose accurate\n",
      "modelling generally requires high computational costs. In this paper, we\n",
      "introduce a new model able to capture the mechanical response of the reactor\n",
      "core subjected to seismic forcing with low computational costs. This model is\n",
      "based on potential flow theory for the fluid part and Euler-Bernoulli beam\n",
      "theory for the structural part allowing us to predict the response to seismic\n",
      "forcing in presence of axial flow.. The linear equations are solved in the\n",
      "Fourier space to decrease computational time. For validation purposes, we first\n",
      "use the proposed model to compute the response of a single cylinder in axial\n",
      "flow. We then implement a multiple cylinder geometry made of 4 fuel assemblies,\n",
      "each made of 8x8 cylinders, corresponding to an experimental facility available\n",
      "at CEA. The comparison between numerical results and experiments show good\n",

      "Abstract: In this article, we demonstrate the novel use of Proper Generalized\n",
      "Decomposition (PGD) to separate the axial and, optionally, polar dimensions of\n",
      "neutron transport. Doing so, the resulting Reduced-Order Models (ROMs) can\n",
      "exploit the fact that nuclear reactors tend to be tall, but geometrically\n",
      "simple, in the axial direction $z$, and so the 3D neutron flux distribution\n",
      "often admits a low-rank \"2D/1D\" approximation. Through PGD, this approximation\n",
      "is computed by alternately solving 2D and 1D sub-models, like in existing 2D/1D\n",
      "models of reactor physics. However, the present methodology is more general in\n",
      "that the decomposition is arbitrary-rank, rather than rank-one, and no\n",
      "simplifying approximations of the transverse leakage are made. To begin, we\n",
      "derive two original models: that of axial PGD -- which separates only $z$ and\n",
      "the axial streaming direction $\\vartheta\\in\\{-1,+1\\}$ -- and axial-polar PGD --\n",
      "which separates both $z$ and polar angle $\\mu$ from the radial domain.\n",
      "Additionally, we grant that the energy dependence $E$ may be ascribed to either\n",
      "radial or axial modes, or both, bringing the total number of candidate 2D/1D\n",
      "ROMs to six. To assess performance, these PGD ROMs are applied to two few-group\n",
      "benchmarks characteristic of Light Water Reactors. Therein, we find both the\n",
      "axial and axial-polar ROMs are convergent and that the latter are often more\n",
      "economical than the former. Ultimately, given the popularity of 2D/1D methods\n",
      "in reactor physics, we expect a PGD ROM which achieves a similar effect, but\n",
      "perhaps with superior accuracy, a quicker runtime, and/or broader\n",
      "applicability, would be eminently useful, especially for full-core problems.\n",

      "Abstract: Phase shaping using fractional order (FO) phase shapers has been proposed by\n",
      "many contemporary researchers as a means of producing systems with iso-damped\n",
      "closed loop response due to a stepped variation in input. Such systems, with\n",
      "the closed loop damping remaining invariant to gain changes can be used to\n",
      "produce dead-beat step response with only rise time varying with gain. This\n",
      "technique is used to achieve an active step-back in a Pressurized Heavy Water\n",
      "Reactor (PHWR) where it is desired to change the reactor power to a\n",
      "pre-determined value within a short interval keeping the power undershoot as\n",
      "low as possible. This paper puts forward an approach as an alternative for the\n",
      "present day practice of a passive step-back mechanism where the control rods\n",
      "are allowed to drop during a step-back action by gravity, with release of\n",
      "electromagnetic clutches. The reactor under a step-back condition is identified\n",
      "as a system using practical test data and a suitable Proportional plus Integral\n",
      "plus Derivative (PID) controller is designed for it. Then the combined plant is\n",
      "augmented with a phase shaper to achieve a dead-beat response in terms of power\n",
      "drop. The fact that the identified static gain of the system depends on the\n",
      "initial power level at which a step-back is initiated, makes this application\n",
      "particularly suited for using a FO phase shaper. In this paper, a model of a\n",

      "Abstract: MOCABA is a combination of Monte Carlo sampling and Bayesian updating\n",
      "algorithms for the prediction of integral functions of nuclear data, such as\n",
      "reactor power distributions or neutron multiplication factors. Similarly to the\n",
      "established Generalized Linear Least Squares (GLLS) methodology, MOCABA offers\n",
      "the capability to utilize integral experimental data to reduce the prior\n",
      "uncertainty of integral observables. The MOCABA approach, however, does not\n",
      "involve any series expansions and, therefore, does not suffer from the\n",
      "breakdown of first-order perturbation theory for large nuclear data\n",
      "uncertainties. This is related to the fact that, in contrast to the GLLS\n",
      "method, the updating mechanism within MOCABA is applied directly to the\n",
      "integral observables without having to \"adjust\" any nuclear data. A central\n",
      "part of MOCABA is the nuclear data Monte Carlo program NUDUNA, which performs\n",
      "random sampling of nuclear data evaluations according to their covariance\n",

      "Abstract: The plant efficiency of a nuclear fusion power plant is considered. During\n",

      "affect both transient dynamics and stability properties. Consequently, it is\n",
      "often necessary to identify and account for the delays when, e.g., designing a\n",

      "equations is not straightforward and requires specialized methods. Therefore,\n",
      "we propose an algorithm for identifying distributed delays in delay\n",
      "differential equations (DDEs) that only involves simulation of ordinary\n",
      "differential equations (ODEs). Specifically, we 1) approximate the kernel in\n",
      "the DDEs (also called the memory function) by the probability density function\n",
      "of a mixed Erlang distribution and 2) use the linear chain trick (LCT) to\n",

      "Abstract: To prevent the unauthorised spread of radioactive materials, it is essential\n",
      "to detect and monitor spent nuclear fuel. This paper investigates the\n",
      "feasibility of using a detector based on transition edge superconductors to\n",
      "monitor spent CANDU fuel in two distinct scenarios. The first of these\n",
      "considered the monitoring of a CANSTOR container at the location of the\n",
      "Gentilly-2 nuclear power plant. The fuel in a CANSTOR container is contained\n",
      "within baskets, which are then stored in tubes in the container. An individual\n",

      "tube in the container is emptied (equivalent to approximately 5% of the fuel in\n",
      "the container), the results are improved. The second scenario examined the\n",
      "feasibility of monitoring a single dry storage container (DSC) at the Pickering\n",
      "site. The DSCs are much smaller than a CANSTOR container and contain\n",
      "approximately 7.4 tonnes of spent fuel. The background due to the neutrinos\n",
      "from the nearby reactors at the Pickering site was also evaluated. It was found\n",
      "that monitoring DSC was unfeasible due to the high reactor neutrino background.\n",
      "Both studies utilized fuel that was 30 years old; monitoring a container loaded\n",
      "with spent fuel that is younger would require a shorter monitoring time due to\n",

      "Abstract: There has been some good news, and some bad news in the controlled fusion\n",
      "community recently. The good news is that the Lawrence Livermore National\n",
      "Laboratory (LLNL) has recently produced a burning plasma. It succeeded on\n",
      "several of its shots where ~1.5-2 megajoules from its laser (National Ignition\n",
      "Facility, or NIF) has generated ~ 1.3-3 megajoules of fusion products. The\n",
      "highest ratio of fusion energy to laser energy it achieved, defined as its Q,\n",
      "was 1.5 at the time of this writing. While LLNL is sponsored by nuclear\n",
      "stockpile stewardship, this author sees a likely path from their result to\n",
      "fusion for energy for the world, a path using a very different laser and a very\n",
      "different target configuration. The bad news is that the International Tokamak\n",
      "Experimental Reactor (ITER) has continued to stumble on more and more delays\n",
      "and cost overruns, as its capital cost has mushroomed from ~$5 billion to ~\n",
      "$25B. This paper argues that the American fusion effort, for energy for the\n",
      "civilian economy, should switch its emphasis not only from magnetic fusion to\n",
      "inertial fusion but should also take much more seriously fusion breeding. Over\n",
      "the next few decades, the world might well be setting up more and more thermal\n",
      "nuclear reactors, and these might need fuel which only fusion breeders can\n",

      "Abstract: The critical heat flux (CHF) is an important thermal-hydraulic parameter that\n",
      "must be determined during the design of water-cooled reactors to ensure safety\n",
      "of operation. In this paper, a methodology is proposed to predict the CHF in\n",
      "VVER rod bundles. A whole-reactor model of VVER-1000 is implemented in\n",
      "RELAP-SCDAPSIM, and, based on the bundle-average approach, the parameters of\n",
      "the hot channel are used to assess four CHF predictors (i.e., the 2006\n",
      "Groeneveld look-up table (LUT), and the Bowring, W-3, Biasi, and OKB-Gidropress\n",
      "correlations) upon comparison with the 2011 Bobkov LUT. A brief critique is\n",
      "given of the correction factors for both the Groeneveld and Bobkov LUTs. The\n",
      "effects of channel diameter and non-uniform axial heat flux on the predicted\n",
      "values of CHF in subcooled conditions are also studied. The performance and\n",
      "time complexity of the standard and Bourke trilinear interpolation algorithms\n",
      "are assessed for use with LUTs in safety codes. It has been concluded that the\n",
      "non-uniform axial heat flux does not affect the CHF in subcooled conditions and\n",
      "that the Groeneveld diameter factor exponent gives better predictability of the\n",
      "CHF in VVER rod bundles over the Tanase and Wong exponent correlations.\n",
      "Additionally, the Groeneveld LUT has been found to nearly reproduces the Bobkov\n",
      "LUT CHF values when used in conjunction with the Bobkov heated length factor.\n",
      "Values of MDNBR equal to 1.83 and 1.96 can be used as thermal limits at 12\\%\n",
      "overpower when the Bowring and W-3 correlations, respectively, are used in\n",
      "subcooled conditions. The standard and Bourke algorithms nearly exhibit the\n",
      "same average CPU time. The Bourke algorithm, however, is less affected by\n",
      "noise. Further research is needed to ensure the smoothness of the Bobkov LUT\n",

      "Abstract: Understanding the coolant thermal hydraulics in rod bundles is essential to\n",

      "Abstract: Graphite-moderated nuclear reactors have already produced more than 250000\n",
      "tons of irradiated nuclear graphite, or i-graphite, world-wide. The\n",
      "sustainability of this technology relies on the end-of-life management of its\n",
      "moderator, which is activated into a long-lived nuclear waste, by neutron\n",
      "fluxes, during operating time. In particular, C14 is created. Nuclear\n",
      "transmutation, enabled by laser-driven particle acceleration, has been\n",
      "envisioned as a potential novel treatment scheme for long-lived nuclear waste.\n",
      "By triggering controlled nuclear reactions with energetic particles, long-lived\n",
      "radionuclides could be transformed into stable isotopes. Such a system could\n",
      "treat the C14 nuclei trapped within the i-graphite matrix, which is difficult\n",
      "to isolate by other means. This work performs a quantitative preliminary study\n",
      "of this transmutation scheme, in order to assess its feasibility at an\n",
      "industrial scale. The method used can be transposed to assess any transmutation\n",
      "scheme using a beam of particles directly sent on the material to be treated.\n",
      "First, a nuclear interaction channel which transmutes C14 nuclei without\n",
      "creating new long-lived radionuclides is identified. It consists in the choice\n",
      "of a type of particle, among which protons, gamma photons and neutrons can all\n",
      "be accelerated by laser-matter interaction; and it is completed by the adequate\n",
      "energy at which this particle must be sent on i-graphite. To that end, the\n",
      "nuclear cross-sections of C12, C13 and C14 are reviewed, neglecting other\n",
      "impurities in i-graphite. Then, based on the interaction channel\n",
      "identification, the energy cost of this scheme is estimated. Protons between 1\n",
      "and 5 MeV make it possible to transmute C14 without creating any new long-lived\n",
      "activity. However, our result show that, even in this favorable reaction\n",

      "plant mechanical system degradation. It describes a causal representation of\n",
      "the phenomena involved in the degradation process. Inference from such a BN\n",
      "needs to specify a great number of marginal and conditional probabilities. As,\n",
      "in the present context, information is based essentially on expert knowledge,\n",
      "this task becomes very complex and rapidly impossible. We present a solution\n",
      "which consists of considering the BN as a log-linear model on which\n",
      "simplification constraints are assumed. This approach results in a considerable\n",
      "decrease in the number of probabilities to be given by experts. In addition, we\n",
      "give some simple rules to choose the most reliable probabilities. We show that\n",
      "making use of those rules allows to check the consistency of the derived\n",
      "probabilities. Moreover, we propose a feedback procedure to eliminate\n",
      "inconsistent probabilities. Finally, the derived probabilities that we propose\n",

      "Abstract: In spring 2019 the international atomic energy agency (IAEA) has run a public\n",
      "competition to look at tomographic reconstruction algorithms for its PGET\n",
      "detector, used to determine activity levels in nuclear reactors spent fuel\n",
      "rods. The algorithm is also supposed to identify missing fuel rods. The task is\n",
      "particularly challenging because uranium rods have a very high cross section\n",
      "for gamma photons in the energy range of interest. Therefore, signal from pins\n",
      "at the center of the assembly is heavily attenuated. Furthermore, most photons\n",
      "reaching the detector will have undergone Compton scattering, originating a\n",
      "high background deprived of spatial information. In this paper, we describe our\n",
      "competition entry. Image reconstruction is based on robust, unbiased, emission\n",
      "tomography algorithms that have been routinely used for decades in nuclear\n",
      "medicine. Attenuation correction is performed by subsequent approximations. An\n",
      "intermediate reconstruction is used to detect missing pins. This information is\n",
      "used to generate the final attenuation map, which is used to generate the image\n",
      "used for quantification. The compton scatter background is estimated by\n",

      "Abstract: Powder metallurgy with hot isostatic pressing (PM-HIP) is an advanced\n",

      "to directly compare PM-HIP to forged SA508 Grade 3 Class 1 low-alloy RPV steel\n",
      "at two neutron irradiation conditions: ~0.5-1.0 displacements per atom (dpa) at\n",
      "~270C and ~370C. PM-HIP SA508 experiences greater irradiation hardening and\n",
      "embrittlement (total elongation) than forged SA508. However, uniform elongation\n",
      "and approximate toughness are comparable across all irradiated materials,\n",
      "suggesting irradiated PM-HIP SA508 exhibits superior ductility at maximum\n",
